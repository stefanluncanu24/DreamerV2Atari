  Step-by-Step Breakdown:


   1. `world_model_optimizer.zero_grad()`: Before calculating new gradients, it's essential to clear any gradients that might have been stored
      from the previous training step. This line resets them to zero.


   2. `world_model_loss = ...`: Here, the total loss for the world model is calculated. It's a sum of four different components:
       * recon_loss: The reconstruction loss (how well the decoder can recreate the original image from the latent state).
       * reward_loss: The reward prediction loss.
       * discount_loss: The discount factor prediction loss.
       * kl_loss: The KL divergence loss, which keeps the prior and posterior distributions of the RSSM in check.


   3. `scaler.scale(world_model_loss).backward()`: This is the core of the gradient calculation.
       * The world_model_loss is a single scalar value that represents how "wrong" the world model was on the given batch.
       * The .backward() method is the magic of PyTorch. It automatically computes the gradient of the world_model_loss with respect to every
         single parameter that was involved in its calculation. In this case, that means all the parameters in the world_model_params list
         (Encoder, RSSM, Decoder, Reward Predictor, Discount Predictor).
       * The scaler.scale(...) part is for Automatic Mixed Precision (AMP). It scales the loss to prevent gradients from becoming too small
         (underflowing) when using lower-precision floating-point numbers (like float16), which can speed up training on modern GPUs.


   4. `scaler.unscale_(...)`, `clip_grad_norm_`, `scaler.step(...)`: This is the gradient application step.
       * scaler.unscale_: This reverses the scaling from the previous step so the gradients are back to their correct magnitude.
       * torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_: This is a crucial technique for stabilizing training. It "clips" the gradients, preventing them from
         becoming too large, which could cause the optimizer to take a massive, destructive step. It rescales the gradients if their overall
         norm exceeds a certain threshold (model_grad_clip).
       * scaler.step(world_model_optimizer): This tells the world_model_optimizer (an Adam optimizer in your case) to take a step and update all
         the world_model_params based on their computed gradients.
       * scaler.update(): This updates the scaler for the next iteration.


  In summary, the gradients are calculated via the .backward() call on the world_model_loss and then applied to the world model's parameters
  using the world_model_optimizer.
