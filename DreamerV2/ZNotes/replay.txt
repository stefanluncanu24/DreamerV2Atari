Your implementation in replay_buffer.py takes a different, but equally valid and very robust, approach.     
       * Instead of sampling an episode first, it treats the entire replay buffer (which contains many concatenated episodes) as one long
         array.
       * It iterates through the buffer to find all possible valid starting indices. A starting index is "valid" if the sequence of      
         sequence_length starting from it does not contain a "done" flag (except possibly at the very end).
       * It collects all these valid starting indices into a list (valid_starts).
       * Finally, it randomly samples the required batch_size of starting indices from this list.

  Will your approach work?


  Yes, your approach will absolutely work. It is a very common and effective way to implement sequence-based replay buffers.


  The main advantage of your method is its simplicity and robustness. By pre-filtering for all valid starting positions across the entire
  buffer, you guarantee that every sampled sequence is valid without needing to handle episode-specific logic during the sampling step   
  itself. It naturally handles episodes of varying lengths stored back-to-back.

  Do you clip to not exceed length minus training sequence length?

  Yes, you do, but you do it implicitly rather than with an explicit `clip` function.
